# X-Team 50 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Make a Google Sheets, list the tasks, who will do it, and use color indication to declare progress. Use the sheet to check-in on a routine basis.


## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Via our Google Sheet, we plan to use color indication to show our group members what we are currently working (yellow) on and what we have completed (green). 


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will talk through our text group chat and make comments about any difficulties we are facing in our Google Sheet. In addition, we will be communicating through the comments in our code.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Establish checkpoints and communicate in our group chat on what tasks need to be done when in order to sure that we all stay on track. 

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
