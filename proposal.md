See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Students today are facing a big issue: not knowing where to sit in lectures. Many days, students feel like they have to come to lecture extremely early in order to sit in their desired seat. This causes a big pile-up outside of the lecture hall and causes a huge traffic jam when the students in the previous lecture are still attempting to leave and there are other students in the next lecture piled up at the door. In addition, many students reserve seats for their friends, making it hard for others to get their desired seats when a large group of students decides to change the row they are sitting in for a given lecture. Also, many times there are not enough seats open for students or they don't want to distrub others who are already sitting in the seats, so these students will go to the back of the lecture room and sit on the floor. Showing up late to lecture is plays a role in this issue and causes unnecessary stress due to the fact that they have to find a seat or interrupt other students' notetaking in order to work their way to an open seat in the middle of the row. With this program, students will not have to face these issues anymore.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)<br/>
Seat Selector


2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  <br/>Include and example format of the output produced.
A user interface that displays avaialable and taken seats. Available seats will be in green and taken seats will be in red. There will be a confirmation upon sucessful reservation of your seat. You may also request a list of available or taken seats as a text represenatation. You will be able to lookup where a friend is sitting and request a seat next to them if available.



3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.



5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
